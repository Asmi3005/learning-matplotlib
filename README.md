# Plots Creation using Matplotlib Python  

## Overview  
This project focuses on mastering data visualization using Matplotlib in Python. You will learn how to create various types of plots, customize their appearance, and save them as images for further use.  

### Learning Objectives  
- Add data from a CSV file to a Pandas DataFrame.  
- Create plots, set marker types and colors.  
- Customize plots with labels, font sizes, grid lines, and legends.  
- Create boxplots and save graphs as image files.  

## Project Structure  

### Task 1: Load Data into Pandas DataFrame  
- Imported the necessary libraries, including `pandas` and `matplotlib`.  
- Loaded data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.  

### Task 2: Plot Graphs with Marker Types and Colors  
- Plotted data using Matplotlib.  
- Customized marker types and colors to enhance the visual appeal of the graphs.  

### Task 3: Customize Plots with Labels, Font Size, Grid Lines, and Legends  
- Added axis labels and adjusted font sizes for better readability.  
- Included grid lines to improve clarity.  
- Added legends to explain plot elements.  

### Task 4: Create Boxplots and Save Graphs  
- Created boxplots to visualize data distributions.  
- Saved the generated graphs as image files for sharing and reuse.
